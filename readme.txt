Stumble! for WordPress extends WordPress to support a "random article" feature, similar to StumbleUpon's StumbleThru. Increases pageviews.

== Description ==

**Stumble! for WordPress** extends WordPress to support a "random article" feature, similar to [StumbleUpon's StumbleThru](http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumblethru.php) and Wikipedia's (Mediawiki's) random article feature.

**It has shown that it can significantly increase pageviews on a blog**.

The plugin supports basic "go to any random page" functionality, but can also integrate with [Yet Another Related Posts Plugin](http://mitcho.com/code/yarpp/) to stumble similar articles. *Stumble! for WordPress* will automatically (optional) give priority to articles with more comments, so users will be brought to your most popular posts.

Since version 0.2, the plugin also shows statistics to show total number of stumbles, and hits to individual articles as a result of Stumble! for WordPress.

**New for version 1.0**: You can now enter the *Stumble! for WordPress* network (from the options panel) which will send your traffic from stumbles from other blogs! (and visa-versa)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `stumble-for-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Settings'->'Stumble! for WordPress' to configure your message and options

The plugin should work straight away, and configuration is optional.

To make the best use of the plugin, please [download YARPP](http://mitcho.com/code/yarpp/) first.

To insert a "stumble" button, simply link it to this URL: http://[Your Blog Location]/?stumble. The options panel will give you the exact link.

To make use of the related posts feature, you need to link to: http://[Your Blog Location]/?stumble=[ID]. Replace [ID] with the post ID. Information will be pulled from YARPP, if available, and the user will be brought to a related post.

== Screenshots ==
