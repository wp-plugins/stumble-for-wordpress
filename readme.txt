== Description ==

**Stumble! for WordPress** extends WordPress to support a "random article" feature, similar to [StumbleUpon's StumbleThru](http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumblethru.php) and Wikipedia's (Mediawiki's) random article feature.

The plugin supports basic "go to any random page" functionality, but can also integrate with [Yet Another Related Posts Plugin](http://mitcho.com/code/yarpp/) to stumble similar articles. *Stumble! for WordPress* will automatically give priority to articles with more comments, so users will be brought to your most popular posts.

The plugin is currently in BETA. Please reports any bugs you find.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `stumble-for-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Settings'->'Stumble! for WordPress' to configure your message and options

The plugin should work straight away, and configuration is optional. Please refer to the settings screen for usage instructions.

== Screenshots ==

1. Picutre of "stumble" button, which is placed (optionally) at the bottom of every article. Integrates with YARPP.
